# Dictionaries
This is a collection of public dictionaries designed for free use in any context, but certainly spell checkers, translators, etc

I often need dictionaries for various projects.
One common need is a spelling dictionary. I use this for class assignments as well as for programs that check for words.
Password programs want to avoid common words. Editors want to make sure these words are spelled right.

It is also nice to have a translation dictionary, for example English-Chinese. This is not going to translate a document
well, but can convert critical terms.
