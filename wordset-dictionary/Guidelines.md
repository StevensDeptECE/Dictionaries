# Guidelines

Wordset is a structured dictionary. As such, we try to follow these guidelines to create a standardized resource. Our overall goal is usability.

## Overall

*   _Kindness_: We strive to be a kind community. Be nice and helpful to people, even if you're frustrated. Give constructive feedback on proposals and explain why you are rejecting a proposal if that’s the case.
*   _Originality_: Do not copy directly from any other dictionaries or sources. Other dictionaries are often strictly licensed, and it's our aim to build a unique and novel online dictionary.
*   _Sourced_: Give sources for proposals where possible and appropriate. Especially when suggesting new words or meanings, a source for your proposal is essential. Examples of good sources include nationally recognized newspapers, magazines, and academic publications.

## Meanings and Examples

*   Avoid the use of gendered pronouns. Instead of using "he" or "she," employ the singular "they.” For example, "They tried sushi for the first time." There is significant [historical precedent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they) for this usage.
*   Avoid the passive voice where possible. For example, "The dog chased the cat," is better than "The cat was chased by the dog."
*   Start example sentences with a capital letter and end sentences with appropriate punctuation.
*   Start all verb definitions with the word “to.” For example, the definition of hurt might read, “to cause damage or pain.”
*   Try to provide context in example sentences. For example, if you are defining the word umbrella, “I like umbrellas,” is a bad example sentence. Someone who doesn't know what the word umbrella means would have a difficult time guessing what the word means based off of that. Instead, try sentences such as, “Since it was raining, I grabbed my gray umbrella to keep myself dry.”
*   Avoid parenthetical citations. They break up definitions and often indicate unessential or extraneous information.
*   Use the [Oxford comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma). For example, write “I want to buy a calculator, a book, and a pencil,” as opposed to writing, “I want to buy a calculator, a book and a pencil.”

## Words and Phrases

*   Avoid adding phrases or groups of words that are merely "X+Y" definitions. These dictionary entries are comprised of string of texts can be defined by defining each individual part of the entry. For example, "young boy" would be a bad dictionary entry or phrase to add since its definition would just be a combination of the definitions for "young" and "boy." Phrases like "yellow journalism" are acceptable since they have a definition which is not merely "X+Y."
*   Our goal is to create a dictionary, so avoid adding words or phrases that belong in an encyclopedia, almanac, or any otherwise resource that isn't a dictionary. For example, Streptococcus pneumoniae does not belong in a dictionary.
